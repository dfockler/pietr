module Pietr
  ##
  # The color class is responsible for converting the
  # color in the image into something that can be used
  # to compute the shade and hue difference between two
  # colors.
  # 
  # Note that the shade and hue 'wrap around'
  # i.e. Light -> Medium -> Dark -> Light
  # So the difference between Dark to Medium is 2 'darker'
